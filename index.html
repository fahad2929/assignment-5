Many homes were submerged, displacing thousands of residents and damaging crops. Roads and communication systems were disrupted, hindering relief efforts. Local authorities and NGOs have been working to provide emergency aid to those affected. The flood has highlighted the region's vulnerability to extreme weather events linked to climate change.</p>
